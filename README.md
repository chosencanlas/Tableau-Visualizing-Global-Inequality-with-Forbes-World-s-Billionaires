# Visualizing Global-Inequality-with-Forbes-World-s-Billionaires

If we think of each country as having its own socioeconomic pyramid, the top of each pyramid would be the richest people within each country. One way we can visualize global wealth inequality is by comparing the top of all pyramids from all countries with each other.Â 

And who are at the top? Billionaires.

In this visualization, I use the Forbes Billionaire list from 2002-2019 to illustrate the inequality between countries by showing the top of the socioeconomic pyramids. The small space between bottom of the pyramids and the x-axis is where everyone else is located.
